# OSNow üåê

Welcome to **OSNow**, an open-source organization that empowers individuals to collaborate and contribute to the development of open-source products that benefit the community at large.

# Tech Stack üíª

At OSNow, we harness the power of modern technologies to build scalable and efficient applications. Here's what we're currently using:

- **Backend**: `Node.js` as our runtime environment to build fast, scalable network applications.
- **Database**: `MongoDB` for our `NoSQL` database, offering flexibility and scalability for our data storage needs.

This combination of technologies allows us to create a seamless, end-to-end experience for our contributors and users alike.
